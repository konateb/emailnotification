## emailnotification

This repository contains the source code for a Node.js application that facilitates sending email notifications.

**Features:**

* Sends email notifications based on triggered events (specific functionality would need to be added in your implementation).
* Leverages the `nodemailer` package for email delivery.
* Uses a `.env` file to store sensitive information like email credentials (set up instructions below).

**Dependencies:**

* `dotenv`: [https://www.npmjs.com/package/dotenv](https://www.npmjs.com/package/dotenv): Used to manage environment variables.
* `nodemailer`: [https://www.npmjs.com/package/nodemailer](https://www.npmjs.com/package/nodemailer): A popular Node.js library for sending emails.

**Installation:**

1. Clone this repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/konateb/emailnotification.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd emailnotification
   ```

3. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

**Configuration:**

1. Create a file named `.env` in the project root directory.

2. Add the following environment variables to the `.env` file, replacing the placeholders with your actual values:

   ```
   MAIL_HOST=smtp.your-email-provider.com
   MAIL_PORT=587
   MAIL_USER=your_email_address
   MAIL_PASS=your_email_password
   ```

   **Important:** Never commit your `.env` file to version control, as it contains sensitive information.

**Usage:**

**Note:** This is a basic framework, and you'll need to implement the specific logic for triggering email notifications and defining the content of the email messages. 

* Refer to the `nodemailer` documentation for available configuration options and methods for sending emails: [https://www.npmjs.com/package/nodemailer](https://www.npmjs.com/package/nodemailer)

**Example (replace with your implementation):**

```javascript
const nodemailer = require('nodemailer');

// Implement logic to trigger email notification and populate content
const recipientEmail = 'recipient@example.com';
const subject = 'Important Notification';
const htmlContent = '<h1>This is an email notification!</h1>';

// Configure email transporter using environment variables
const transporter = nodemailer.createTransport({
  host: process.env.MAIL_HOST,
  port: process.env.MAIL_PORT,
  auth: {
    user: process.env.MAIL_USER,
    pass: process.env.MAIL_PASS,
  },
});

// Send email notification
transporter.sendMail({
  from: process.env.MAIL_USER,
  to: recipientEmail,
  subject: subject,
  html: htmlContent,
}, (error, info) => {
  if (error) {
    console.error(error);
  } else {
    console.log('Email notification sent:', info.response);
  }
});
```
